                    <p>Confidentiality Preferences let you decide if your complaint stays private with HR or can be shared with others involved in resolving the issue. These are:</p>

                    <ul class="ms-2">
                        <li>
                            <b>Share with Relevant Parties: </b>
                            The complaint will be shared with specific individuals or departments involved in addressing the issue but not broadly distributed.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <b>Internal Use Only: </b>
                            The complaint will be used internally for review and resolution but not disclosed beyond the HR department or specific personnel.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Public Summary: </b>
                            A summary of the complaint may be shared publicly (e.g., aggregated data) but without revealing specific details or identities.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Anonymous: </b>
                            The complaint can be submitted without disclosing your/the complainantâ€™s identity, ensuring privacy while addressing the issue.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Discreet Handling: </b>
                            The complaint will be handled discreetly by HR with minimal sharing, focusing on resolving the issue while maintaining confidentiality as much as possible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <small><b>Note: </b> Your confidentiality preferences will be handled in accordance with the <b>Data Privacy Act of 2012</b> and other relevant regulations to ensure your personal information is protected and used appropriately.</small>
