        <h4 class="fw-bold">1.1.1 History</h4>
        <p>
            POWERLANE RESOURCES, INC. (PRI) began its journey in March 1992, serving its first client, FEDCO PAPER.
            The company quickly gained momentum, adding THE REGION BANK (now known as PLANTERS BANK) to its roster
            shortly after.
        </p>
        <p>
            By early 1995, PRI's success necessitated a move to a larger office space. This expansion allowed the
            company
            to efficiently manage a growing workforce exceeding 1,000 employees and cater to the needs of a wider client
            base.
            Additionally, it established the first full-service branch office in Imus, Cavite. This branch later
            relocated to a more
            spacious location within Hausland Subdivision for improved service.
        </p>
        <p>
            PRI continued its strategic growth by opening additional branches in Gen. Trias, Cavite (catering to Gateway
            Business Park
            and First Cavite Industrial Estate) and Rosario, Cavite (August 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant milestone occurred in February 2005 when PRI earned accreditation from the Subic Bay
            Metropolitan Authority (SBMA).
            This achievement allowed it to establish a full-service branch within SBMA and provide manpower services to
            a new client,
            NIDEC Subic Phils., Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company's commitment to expansion continued throughout the following decade. In 2010, a new branch
            opened in Ermita, Manila,
            to cater to the MAX's group of companies. PRI further solidified its national presence by launching branches
            in Makati (2011),
            Clark Freeport Zone, Pampanga, and Batangas.
